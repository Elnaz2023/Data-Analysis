# Data-Analysis
I would like to present a few sample projects that I have supervised and guided as a mentor to students. We discuss the fundamental stages of data analysis over the course of 4 weeks. My gratitude is for the diligent and innovative reports submitted by the bright students in the class during different semesters of the year 2022-2023, who hail from esteemed universities and have dedicated 5 hours each week to completing the program and their reports.
